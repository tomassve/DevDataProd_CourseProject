### Introduction
You can with this app interactively test how well different set of predictors can estimate the fuel consumption in miles per gallon (*mpg*).

The app uses the *mtcars* data set in R.

### Predictors
To the left you will find the set a predictors and you can choose any set of size 0 or more.
1. cyl
2. disp
3. hp
4. drat
5. wt
6. qsec
7. vs
8. am
9. gear

### Tabsets
There are 5 tabs in this app. They implements a work flow to get a predictor of *mpg*. Start with the *Data set* and work the tabs from left to right. 

#### Data set
The data was extracted from the 1974 *Motor Trend US* magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-Â–74 models) .

Get acquainted with the data set.

#### Pairs plot
Explore correlation between predictors and mpg from the matrix of scatter plots .

#### Prediction plot
Here you can see the predicted value, the *mpg* value from the data set along with the prediction error. All are plotted on the same scale. 

Test different set of predictors until you are satisfied.

#### Model summary
You will find information on the regression model for your selection on predictors.

#### Diagnostic plots
You can investigate the presence of outliers, the normality of the residual and the leverage of the different data points. 

These are useful for evaluating your predictor.
